Exercises:

What are the three main advantages of ggplot2 relative to previous plotting systems such as grid and lattice?
What is the purpose of multi-layer graphics?
What are the two different reasons for creating multi-panel graphics? Which of these two types is useful with interactivity?
Let us define “A < B” to mean that “one B can contain several A.” Which of the following statements is true?

ggplot < panel
panel < ggplot
ggplot < animint
animint < ggplot
layer < panel
panel < layer
layer < ggplot
ggplot < layer
In the viz.aligned facets, why is it important to use the scales="free" argument?
In viz.aligned we showed a ggplot with a scatterplot panel on the left and a time series panel on the right. Make another version of the data visualization with the time series panel on the left and the scatterplot panel on the right.
In viz.aligned the scatterplot displays fertility rate and life expectancy, but the time series displays only fertility rate. Make another version of the data visualization that shows both time series. Hint: use both horizontal and vertical panels in facet_grid.
Use aes(size=population) in the scatterplot to show the population of each country. Hint: scale_size_animint(pixel.range=c(5, 10) means that circles with a radius of 5/10 pixels should be used represent the minimum/maximum population.
Create a multi-panel data visualization that shows each year of the WorldBank data set in a separate panel. What are the limitations of using static graphics to visualize these data?
Create viz.aligned using a plotting system that is not based on the grammar of graphics. For example, you can use functions from the graphics package in R (plot, points, lines, etc), or matplotlib in Python. What are some advantages of ggplot2 and animint?

Next, Chapter 3 explains the showSelected keyword, which indicates a variable to use for subsetting the data before plotting.
